This file is a standalone program that reads commands on
stdin and executes them (each line should be a command).

Usage: cat some_fifo | ./daemon.py

Poezio writes commands in the fifo, and this daemon executes them on the
local machine.
Note that you should not start this daemon if you do not trust the remote
machine that is running poezio, since this could make it run any (dangerous)
command on your local machine.
