Configure
=========

The configuration is located in the file *~/.config/poezio/poezio.cfg*
On its first startup, poezio will create that file (and its containing
directories) with the default configuration. You can edit that file manually
or use the */set* command to edit some of its values directly from poezio.
This file is also used to configure key bindings, but this is explained
in the _keys_ documentation file.

That file is read at each startup and the configuration is saved when poezio
is closed.

This configuration file *requires* all global options to be in a section
named [Poezio]. Some other options can be in optional sections and will
apply only to tabs having the option’s name.

An option is formatted with the form
======================
option = value
======================

An empty value *doesn’t* mean that the default value will be used. That’s
just an empty value. To use the default value, just comment or remove the
option entirely.

Here is a list of all the avalaible configuration options, their meaning
and their default value.

Configuration options
---------------------

Global section options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These option have a sense when they are in the global section. Some of
them can also be in an optional configuration section, see the next
section of this documentation.

[horizontal]
*server*:: anon.louiz.org

  The server to use for *anonymous* authentication.
  Make sure it accepts anonymous authentification
  Note that this option doesn’t do anything at all if you’re using your own JID.

*certificate*:: [empty]

  The fingerprint of the SSL certificate as a hexadecimal string, you should
  not touch it, except if know what you are doing.

*ignore_certificate*:: false

  Skip certificate validation on connection when _true_. Useful when you are in
  anonymous mode and changing servers often. Dangerous in other cases, from a
  security perspective.

*ca_cert_path*:: [empty]

  Path to the certificate of the Certification Authority.
  As some services may keep different certificates, it is an alternative to
  the Trust On First Use model provided by _certificate_. This option is not
  affected by _ignore_certificate_ and boths checks may be active at the same
  time.

*whitespace_interval*:: 300

  Interval of the whitespace keepalive sending to the server.
  300 should be fine, but change it if some services have a stricter policy
  on client inactivity.

*resource*:: [empty]

  the resource you will use
  If it's empty, your resource will be chosen (most likely randomly) by the server
  It is not recommended to use a resource that is easy to guess, because it can lead
  to presence leak.

*auto_reconnect*:: false

  Auto-reconnects you when you get disconnected. Should not be necessary, so
  the default is false.


*default_nick*:: [empty]

  the nick you will use when joining a room with no associated nick
  If this is empty, the $USER environnement variable will be used


*jid*:: [empty]

  Jabber identifiant. Specify it only if you want to connect using an existing
  account on a server. This is optional and useful only for some features,
  like room administration, nickname registration.
  The 'server' option will be ignored if you specify a JID (Jabber identifiant)
  It should be in the form nickname@server.tld

*password*:: [empty]

  A password is needed only if you specified a jid. It will be ignored otherwise
  If you leave this empty, the password will be asked at each startup

*rooms*:: poezio@muc.poezio.eu

  the rooms you will join automatically on startup, with associated nickname or not
  format : room@server.tld/nickname:room2@server.tld/nickname2
  default_nick will be used if "/nickname" is not specified

*use_bookmark_method*:: [empty]

    the method that poezio will use to store your bookmarks online.
    possible values are: privatexml, pep
    You should not have to edit this in a normal use case.

*use_remote_bookmarks*:: true

    use this option to force the use of local bookmarks if needed.
    Anything but "false" will be counted as true.

*after_completion*:: ,

  what will be put after the name, when using autocompletion
  a SPACE will always be added after that

*words*:: [empty]

  Personal dictionary of the words you use often, that you want to complete

  completion will work in chatrooms, private conversations, and direct
  conversations.

*highlight_on*:: [empty]

  a list of words (separated by a colon (:)) that will be
  highlighted if said by someone on a room

*enable_xhtml_im*:: true

  XHTML-IM is an XMPP extension letting users send messages
  containing XHTML and CSS formating. We can use this to make
  colored text for example.
  It is disabled by default because this is only in an experimental
  state: you could miss some part of a message (mainly the URL)
  but you can still send colored messages. You just won’t be able te see
  the colors, though
  Set to true if you want to see colored messages

*hide_status_change*:: 120

  Set a number for this setting.
  The join OR status-change notices will be
  displayed according to this number.
  -1: the notices will ALWAYS be displayed
   0: the notices will NEVER be displayed
   n: On any other number, the notices will only be displayed
      if the user involved has talked since the last n seconds
  if the value is incorrect, -1 is assumed
  Default setting means :
   - status changes won't be displayed unless
     the user talked in the last 2 minutes

*hide_exit_join*:: -1

  Exact same thing than hide_status_change, except that it concerns
  the quit message, and that it will be hidden only if the value is 0.
  Default setting means:
   - all quit and join notices will be displayed

*send_initial_presence*:: true

 Send initial presence (normal behaviour). If false, you will not send nor
 receive any presence that is not directed (through /presence) or sent by a
 MUC.

*display_user_color_in_join_part*:: false

  messages, instead of the default color from the theme.

*information_buffer_popup_on*:: error roster warning help info

  Some informational messages (error, a contact getting connected, etc)
  are sometimes added to the information buffer. These settings can make
  that buffer grow temporarly so you can read these information when they
  appear.

  A list of message types that should make the information buffer grow
  Possible values; error, roster, warning, info, help

*popup_time*:: 4

  set to 'true' if you want to automatically rejoin the
  room when you're kicked.

*autorejoin_delay*:: 5

  Set to the number of seconds before reconnecting after getting kicked.
  0, a negative value, or no value means you instant reconnection.
  This option only works if autorejoin is enabled.

*alternative_nickname*:: [empty]

  If you want poezio to join
  the room with an alternative nickname when
  your nickname is already in use in the room you
  wanted to join, put a non-empty value.
  Else, poezio won't join the room
  This value will be added to your nickname to
  create the alternative nickname.
  For example, if you set "\_", and wanted to use
  the nickname "john", your alternative nickname
  will be "john_"

*muc_history_length*:: 50

  Limit the number of messages you want to receive when the
  multiuserchat rooms send you recent history
  0: You won't receive any
  -1: You will receive the maximum
  n: You will receive at most n messages
  Note that if you set a huge number (like the default value), you
  may not receive that much messages. The server has its own
  maximum too

*use_log*:: true

  set to 'false' if you don’t want to save logs of all the messages
  in files.


*log_dir*:: [empty]

  If log_dir is not set, logs will be saved in $XDG_DATA_HOME/poezio/logs,
  i.e. in ~/.local/share/poezio/logs/. So, you should specify the directory
  you want to use instead. This directory will be created if it doesn't exist

*show_inactive_tabs*:: true

  If you want to show all the tabs in the Tab bar, even those
  with no activity, set to true. Else, set to false

*show_tab_names*:: false

  If you want to show the tab name in the bottom Tab bar, set this to true.

*show_tab_numbers*:: true

  numbers will still be displayed.

*use_tab_nicks*:: true

  The tabs have a name, and a nick, which is, for a contact, its name in the
  roster, or for a private conversation, the nickname in the MUC. Set this to
  true if you want to have them shown instead of the jid of the contact.

*show_muc_jid*:: true

  Set this to false if you want to display only the *user* part of the MUC
  jid. E.g. if you have poezio@muc.poezio.eu, it will be displayed as
  `poezio`. This will be used only if use_tab_nicks is set to true.

*show_roster_jids*:: true

  Set this to false if you want to hide the JIDs in the roster (and keep only
  the contact names). If there is no contact name, the JID will still be
  displayed.

*roster_show_offline*:: false

  Set this to true if you want to display the offline contacts too.

*roster_sort*:: jid:show

  How you want the contacts to be sorted inside the roster groups. The given
  methods are used sequentially (from left to right), so the last one is the
  one on the far right.

  Available methods are :
    * reverse: reverse the current sorting
    * jid: sort by JID (alphabetical order)
    * show: sort by show (available/away/xa/…)
    * name: sort by roster name (if no name, then the bare jid is used)
    * resource: sort by resource number
    * online: sort by online presence (online or not)

  Those methods can be arranged however you like, and they have to be
  separated by colons (":"). If there are more than 3 or 4 chained
  sorting methods, your sorting is most likely inefficient.

  How to sort the roster groups. The principles are the same as _roster_sort_
  (see above).

  Available methods are:
    * reverse: reverse the current sorting
    * name: sort by group name (alphabetical order)
    * fold: sort by unfolded/folded

             someone from a MUC)
  - message (any message from a MUC)

*themes_dir*:: [empty]

  If themes_dir is not set, themes will searched for in $XDG_DATA_HOME/poezio/themes,

  exist


*theme*:: [empty]

  The name of the theme file (without the .py extension) that will be used.
