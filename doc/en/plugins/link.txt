Link
====

Opens links in a browser.

Installation
------------

First use case: local use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you use poezio on your workstation, this is for you.
You only have to load the plugin:

==============

 /load link

==============

Second use case: remote use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you use poezio through SSH, this is for you.

NOTE: Small explanation: Poezio will create a
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_pipe[Unix FIFO] and send the commands in,
and you will have to run a dæmon locally with ssh, to get those commands.

First, set the _exec_remote_ option in the config file to _true_. Then select
the directory you want to put the fifo in (default is the current
 directory, _./_), the _poezio.fifo_ file will be created there.

After that, load the plugin:

============

 /load link

============

And open a link with _/link_ (as described below), this will create the FIFO.

You need to grab poezio’s sources on your client computer, or at least the
http://gitweb.louiz.org/?p=poezio;a=blob_plain;f=src/daemon.py;hb=HEAD[daemon.py]
file.

Finally, on your client computer, run the ssh command:

============

 ssh toto@example.org "cat ~/poezio/poezio.fifo" | python3 daemon.py

===========


Usage
-----
This plugin adds a _/link_ command that will open the links in _firefox_. If
you want to use another browser, you can use the _/set_ command  to change the
_browser_ option in the config file.


_/link_ without argument will open the last received link, if any is found.
If an integer argument is given, /link will go back gradually in the buffer
to open the previous link, and so on.


If you are scrolling in the buffer, poezio will open the links starting from
the first you can see. (although there are some problems with multiline
messages).
