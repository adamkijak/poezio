Poezio in the GNU/Linux distributions
-------------------------------------

As far as I know, Poezio is available in the following distributions, you just
 have to install it by using the package manager of the distribution, if you're
 using one of these.

* *Archlinux*: A poezio and poezio-git packages are in AUR (use your favourite
 AUR wrapper to install them)
* *Frugalware*: Just use pacmang-g2 to install the poezio package. (Thanks to
 its maintainer, Kooda)
* *Debian*: Use an other distro.

(If an other distribution provides a poezio package, please tell us and we will
 add it to the list)


Install poezio from the sources
-------------------------------

You can download poezio's https://dev.louiz.org/project/poezio/download[stable
 sources] or fetch the development version (trunk), using git:
============================
git clone https://git.louiz.org/poezio
============================

In order for poezio to correctly work, you need the libs SleekXMPP and
 dnspython. You can install them by downloading it from the
 https://github.com/fritzy/SleekXMPP/[SleekXMPP] page and the
 http://www.dnspython.org/[dnspython] page , but you'll need the development
 version of SleekXMPP. Alternatively, you can download poezio's sources
 including SleekXMPP and dnspython, that's the easier way.

=== Dependencies ===

NOTE: If your python3 version is too old because of debian (e.g. < 3.2), you
should install the python3-argparse package if it exists, or use
pip3/virtualenvs to install it.

If you want to install SleekXMPP and dnspython by yourself, follow these
 instructions. Else, go to the next section (recommended).


Download SleekXMPP
============================
git clone git://github.com/louiz/SleekXMPP.git
============================

Make sure you're using the develop branch by typing
============================
cd SleekXMPP

git checkout develop
============================

Install SleekXMPP with
============================
python3 setup.py build

su -c "python3 setup.py install"
============================

Install the dnspython3 package on your distribution or install it manually:
============================
wget -O dnspython.tgz http://www.dnspython.org/kits3/1.10.0/dnspython3-1.10.0.tar.gz

tar xvf dnspython.tgz

cd dnspython3-1.10.0
============================

And do the same again:
============================
python3 setup.py build

su -c "python3 setup.py install"
============================


=== Poezio installation ===

If you skipped the installation of the dependencies and you only want to test
 poezio without a system-wide install, do, in the _poezio_ directory:
============================
sh update.sh
============================

If you have git installed, it will download and update locally the
 libraries for you.


If you don't want to install poezio but just test it (or keep a development
 version), do:
============================
 ./launch.sh
============================


To install poezio, do, as root (or sudo with ubuntu or whatever):
============================
make install
============================

And then start it with:
============================
poezio
============================
