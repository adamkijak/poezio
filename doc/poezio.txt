Poezio documentation
====================

This page is the documentation for poezio.

Poezio is an XMPP console client mostly written in python and a little
bit in C.

It uses curses to draw its user interface.

It has been written to create an XMPP client that could very easily be used by
any IRC user. Its interface tries to be like the ones of famous clients such
as irssi or weechat.

== Usage ==

Poezio is composed of tabs which can be of various types. Each tab type has
a distinct interface, list of commands and list of key shortcuts, in addition
to the global commands and key shortcuts.


=== Commands ===

Commands start with the */* character and can take a list of any number
of arguments, separated by spaces. If an argument should contain a space,
you can use the *"* character to surround this argument.

.The command nick with only one argument
==========================================
/nick "my new nick"
==========================================

.The command status with two arguments
==========================================
/status away "on vacation"
==========================================

.Note
The character *'* cannot be used instead of *"*.


To know the list of all available commands, use the *help* command with no
argument. To know more about the command (what it does and how to use it),
use the *help* command and pass the command name as its first argument.

The list of all global commands is as follow:

[horizontal]
*help*:: [command_name] + 
  Displays the list of all available commands in the current tab, or displays
  the usage of the given command.
*message*:: <jid> [message] + 
  Open a conversation with the specified JID, and send a message to it,
  if specified.
